killswitch-applet
=================

killswitch-applet is a small application sitting in the system tray
providing the possibility to manage all the killswitches found in the
system. In this context, "managing" means enabling or disabling certain
killswitches. This is especially useful if you have multiple killswitches
like bluetooth, WWAN or WLAN.


Installation
============

 $ ./setup.py install


Have fun,
 Holger
